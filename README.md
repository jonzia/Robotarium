# Robotarium

Training autonomous agents to perform herding tasks using reinforcement learning.

## User Guide (MATLAB)
1. Clone the [Robotarium MATLAB repository](https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium-matlab-simulator).
2. Run *init.m* in the Robotarium MATLAB simulator folder.
3. To train a model using reinforcement learning, run *RL.mlx*. Alternatively, a pre-trained model *net.m* is provided for a configuration with one leader agent and five follower agents.
4. The trained model may be tested in the Robotarium MATLAB simulator with *main.m*.

The video files entitled *ideal_simulation.avi*, *robotarium_simulation.avi*, and *robotarium_video* provide full-access video described in the text, "Training Networked Agents to Perform Herding Tasks using Reinforcement Learning."
